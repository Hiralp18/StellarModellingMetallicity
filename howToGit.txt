Push Some Changes:

From the command line while you are in the StellarModellingMetallicity, do:

1. git add filename.txt/filename.py (for adding specific files or do “git add *” to add everything in the folder if you are sure there are no junk files. It might produce some warnings, ignore them)

2. git commit -m “description of the commit”
3. git push

Syncing with the master / Getting other people’s changes:
1. git pull
